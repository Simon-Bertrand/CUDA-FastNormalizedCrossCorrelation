To complete the implementation:

- Implement the CPU version
- Implement CC autograd backward GPU and CPU (Using conv and conv transpose)
- Implement ZNCC autograd backward GPU and CPU (hardest)

They are available (as slower vesion) in Python with : https://github.com/Simon-Bertrand/FastCrossCorr-PyTorch
